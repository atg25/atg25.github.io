excerpt: "First post. A quick intro to who I am and what this blog is about."

Every blog needs a first post, so here we go.

## Who am I?

I'm Andrew — a product engineer in my 20s with a deep interest in AI and building things that actually matter. I studied at NJIT, spend too much time on side projects, and genuinely enjoy the craft of software.

## What is this?

Andy's Archive is where I write about things I'm learning, building, and thinking about. Expect posts on:

- **AI & LLMs** — how I'm using them, where they fall short, where they surprise me
- **Product engineering** — building products people actually want to use
- **Side projects** — what I'm working on and what I'm learning from it
- **Misc** — whatever else is taking up space in my head

No rigid schedule. No fluff. Just honest writing when I have something worth saying.

If any of that sounds interesting, stick around. The best way to follow along is to bookmark this page and check back every now and then.

Let's build something.
