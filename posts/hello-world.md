title: "Hello World"
date: "2026-02-20"
excerpt: "The first post — where every blog begins."

Every blog starts with a hello world. This is mine.

## How this works

Posts live in the `posts/` folder as Markdown files. Each file needs a frontmatter block at the top:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2026-02-20"
excerpt: "A short description shown in the post list."
---

Your post content goes here...
```

Filenames become URL slugs. `hello-world.md` → `/blog/hello-world`.

## Writing

Just drop a new `.md` file in `posts/`, commit, push — GitHub Actions will rebuild and redeploy the site automatically.

That's it. Happy blogging.
