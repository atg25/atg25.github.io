In 2022, I walked onto campus as a freshman Computer Science major. Like many others, I thought that was the only way to build a career in tech. I spent my first year staring at code, trying to fit into a mold that didn't quite feel right. I was learning the basics, but I kept missing the bigger picture — how people actually _use_ technology.

## The First Pivot

By sophomore year I wanted something more. I discovered the **Web and Information Systems (WIS)** program — focused on how systems work together and how users interact with data. I picked it up as a minor, and suddenly my classes felt relevant. I was still doing the heavy lifting in CS, but WIS gave me the context I'd been looking for.

## Making the Switch

The real shift happened in the first semester of junior year. My passion for the _how_ and _why_ of technology was clearly stronger than my interest in pure theory. So I made the call — I switched my major to WIS and kept Computer Science as a minor.

It was a scary moment. It felt like stepping off the "standard" path. But I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. I was finally studying what I loved.

## Letting Go to Level Up

Second semester of junior year brought another crossroads. The CS minor was starting to feel like baggage — taking time away from the things I actually wanted to build. I dropped it entirely.

Some people thought I was giving up. I was actually doubling down. Clearing my schedule of classes that didn't serve my goals gave me the time to go deep on **AI-driven Product Engineering**.

## Finding My Edge

Today I'm fully focused on building products powered by AI. While the traditional CS path has its merits, I've spent my time learning how to implement AI in the real world — building, testing, shipping, and learning from what breaks. That hands-on focus has given me an edge I wouldn't have found staying on the default track.

I'm not just writing code. I'm building solutions.

## Keep Moving Forward

There's a quote from _Meet the Robinsons_ that stuck with me: **"Keep moving forward."**

My journey wasn't a straight line. It was full of changes, doubts, and pivots. CS to WIS. Minor added. Minor swapped. Minor dropped. Each decision felt risky in the moment and obvious in hindsight.

If you're stuck in a major that doesn't feel right — it's okay to change direction. Every step I took brought me closer to what I actually love doing. Adjust the plan as many times as you need to. Keep moving. You'll find your path.
