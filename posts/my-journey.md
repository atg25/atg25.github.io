# Keep Moving Forward: My Journey Through Tech and Finding My Path

In 2022, I walked onto campus as a freshman Computer Science major. Like many others, I thought this was the only way to build a career in tech. I spent my first year staring at code and trying to fit into a mold that did not quite feel right. I was learning the basics, but I felt like I was missing the bigger picture of how people actually use technology.

### The First Pivot

By my sophomore year, I realized I wanted something more. I discovered the Web and Information Systems (WIS) program. It focused on how systems work together and how users interact with data. I decided to pick it up as a minor. Suddenly, my classes felt more relevant. I was still doing the heavy lifting in CS, but WIS gave me the context I was looking for.

### Making the Switch

The real shift happened during the first semester of my junior year. I realized that my passion for the "how" and "why" of technology was stronger than my interest in pure theory. I made a big decision. I switched my major to Web and Information Systems and kept Computer Science as a minor.

This was a scary moment. It felt like I was stepping away from the "standard" path. However, I felt a weight lift off my shoulders. I was finally studying what I loved.

### Letting Go to Level Up

By the second semester of my junior year, I hit another crossroads. I was still carrying the CS minor, but it was starting to feel like baggage. It was taking time away from the things I actually wanted to build. I decided to drop the minor entirely.

Some people thought I was giving up, but I was actually doubling down. By clearing my schedule of classes that did not serve my goals, I found the time to dive deep into AI-driven Product Engineering.

### Finding My Edge

Today, I am fully focused on building products powered by AI. While my CS friends are still working through traditional theory, I have spent my time learning how to actually implement AI in the real world. I have spent so much time building, testing, and learning that I now understand AI development better than many of the people who stayed on the traditional path.

I am not just writing code. I am building solutions.

### Keep Moving Forward

There is a great quote from the movie _Meet the Robinsons_ that says, "Keep moving forward." My journey was not a straight line. It was full of changes, doubts, and pivots. I shifted from CS to WIS, added a minor, swapped them, and eventually let one go.

If you are feeling confused or stuck in your major, remember that it is okay to change direction. Every step I took brought me closer to what I actually love doing. No matter how many times you have to adjust your plan, keep moving. You will find your path, and you will be happy when you get there.
